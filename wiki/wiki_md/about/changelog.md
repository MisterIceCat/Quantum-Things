## 1.2.1

### Fixes

- Named the new variants of Spectre wood consistently with vanilla (Spectre Planks > Spectre Wood Planks) (Introduced in 1.2.0).
- Fixed a crash from CustomClassWriter on newer java versions. ([courtesy of Leclowndu93150](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/55))

## 1.2.0

### Changes

- Added Legacy mode for Time in a Bottle, allowing you to revert to the old per-item storage via NBT instead of global player storage.
- Added `/qt` as an alias for `/rt`.
- Added `/rt timeinabottle transfer <playername> <time><s|m|h|d>` to let players transfer their stored Time in a Bottle value to other players.
- Time in a Bottle now stores the last player to hold it, useful for modpack developers to track who uses it in a recipe.
- Added the ability to configure whether Spectre Illuminators should be disabled.
- Added ore dictionary support to many more recipes and items.
- Added Spectre variants of Stairs, Fences, Fence Gates and Slabs.

### Fixes

- Fixed crashes and duplication issues when pistons moved tile-entity blocks with Quark movable tile entities enabled. Affected blocks: Advanced Item Collector, Advanced Redstone Interface, Biome Radar, Diaphanous Block, Entity Detector, Filtered Super Lubricent Platform, Iron Dropper, Light Redirector, Sound Box, and Block Breaker.
- Fixed Diaphanous Block dropping its item when broken in Creative Mode.
- Fixed not all Custom Workbench variants being visible in the Creative Tab and JEI.
- Massively improved Spectre Illuminator performance and reduced overhead of the Spectre Illuminator system (even when there are no Spectre Illuminators in the world).

## 1.1.0

### Changes

- Added the ability to configure the chance for a Spectre Leaf to drop an Ectoplasm.
- Added ore dictionary support for various items and crafting recipes, improving compatibility with other mods and modpacks.
- Added the ability to configure whether Spectre Tools should be disabled.
- Added the ability to configure whether Spectre Armor should be disabled.
- Added the ability to configure whether Luminous Blocks should emit light (disabled by default).

### Fixes

- Fixed Curse Of Binding enchanted items being able to be removed from the player's armor slots when using the Player Interface.
- Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException related to redstone scheduling (introduced in 1.0.6).

## 1.0.9

### Changes

- Added `/rt timeinabottle <playername> <add|query|set|subtract> [number]` commands for managing stored Time in a Bottle values.

### Fixes

- Fixed Time in a Bottle bottled time resetting on death or when returning from the End (introduced in 1.0.8).

## 1.0.8

### Changes

- Changed Time in a Bottle to store bottled time per player (in a global capability) instead of in the item's NBT. Time is no longer tied to the physical bottle. (This may break custom recipes or mod integrations that rely on the item's NBT. If you are a mod/pack dev, plan accordingly before updating.)
- Re-used vanilla textures for the Potion Vaporizer and Block Breaker, instead of copying vanilla textures.
- Added the ability to configure whether Ancient Brick blocks can be broken and will drop their item forms, allowing you to remove them, use them as decoration, or rebuild them elsewhere.
- Simplified and improved the logic (and performance slightly) for checking if the Ender Dragon has been defeated. It should now also register the dragon death even when the mod is not installed.
- Removed the unimplemented and unfinished RezStone (Blood Stone) item and the Revive Circle entity.

### Fixes

- Possibly fixed wavey tile entities when using Time in a Bottle (testing required).
- Fixed a crash in the Debug World when it tried to render invalid rune textures.
- Fixed certain textures having a white-ish tint applied (introduced in 1.0.2).
- Fixed a rare crash when migrating Divining Rods from the old to the new system (introduced in 1.0.6).
- Fixed multiple crashes when loading the mod on servers. (Introduced in ???) ([courtesy of DeliciousBread481](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/32))

## 1.0.6

### Changes

- Increased the Spectre Armor toughness to 3.0 from 0.0 (1 above diamond).
- Changed the Redstone Activator to emit a sided signal based on the block face clicked. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
- Reworked the internals of the (Advanced) Redstone Interface/Observer/Activator/Remote. This should improve redstone performance, even if you aren't using any of these blocks/items in your world. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
- Changed the Redstone Interface & Observer to only send/receive signals from their target(s) once the target(s) are loaded. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
