## About Random Things

Random Things is a miscellaneous mod that adds a diverse collection of utility items, blocks, and gameplay enhancements. It includes features such as automated item collection, crop growth acceleration with Fertilized Dirt, a personal pocket dimension called the Spectre Dimension, Spectre Coils for wireless energy transfer, Divining Rods for locating ores, various redstone utilities, decorative blocks, and numerous quality-of-life improvements. The mod is designed to complement other mods by adding convenience features and new gameplay without adhering to a specific theme. To put it in Lumien's words:

> Random Things is a collection of features that i thought would be neat. The mod doesn't really have a central topic so it's best played alongside other mods.

The goal of Quantum Things is to provide continued support for Random Things, such as new features, bug and crash fixes, and compatibility with other mods, while saying true to the original design goal and intent of the mod.

## Changes and fixes

### Changes

- Added the ability to enable or disable the Spectre Sapling.
- Added the ability to enable or disable the Spectre Dimension.

- Added Divining Rod sleeper support for Silent Gear, More Planets, Aether and Aether II. (Sleeper Support is for mods lacking oreDict. Does nothing by default, can be enabled by modpacks).
- Gave Spectre Illuminator LOD levels.
- Made Rain Shields be able to be placed on any block, similar to an end rod.
- Added the ability to configure the Spectre Energy Injector capacity, Spectre Coil/Charger transfer rates, and whether the Genesis Spectre Coil generates energy or transfers it.
- Made the ID Card crafting recipe shapeless.
- Re-added Spectre Armor.
- Added an Imbuing Station recipe for Spectre Armor, requiring a Diamond Armor piece and 3 Spectre Ingots (NBT is transferred).
- Added the ability to configure the transparency effect of the Spectre Armor.
- Re-added Biome Painter and Biome Capsule from 1.7.10.
- Re-added Obsidian Stick from 1.7.10, now used for Spectre Tools and the Biome Painter.
- Added the Spectre Hoe.
- Added the ability to configure whether Golden Chickens should produce gold ingots automatically (legacy), or only when fed gold ore (current).
- Added the ability to configure the maximum number of blocks a Potion Vaporizer can affect.
- Reduced the number of particles spawned by the Potion Vaporizer by several orders of magnitude.
- Changed the Ancient Furnace to change blocks in a circular area around it, rather than a diamond shape.
- Added a Proportional power mode to the Entity Detector.
- Added the ability to configure a blacklist of entities that cannot be captured by the Summoning Pendulum.
- Creative players can now capture any entity with the Summoning Pendulum, bypassing all restrictions.
- Added a failure sound when the Summoning Pendulum blocks the capture of an entity.
- Added optional durability to Divining Rods, alongside Unbreaking and Mending eligibility (disabled by default).
- Changed the Redstone Activator to emit a sided signal based on the block face clicked. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
- Reworked the internals of the (Advanced) Redstone Interface/Observer/Activator/Remote. This should improve redstone performance, even if you aren't using any of these blocks/items in your world. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
- Changed the Redstone Interface & Observer to only send/receive signals from their target(s) once the target(s) are loaded. ([courtesy of ChaosStrikez](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/22))
- Changed Time in a Bottle to store bottled time per player (in a global capability) instead of in the item's NBT. Time is no longer tied to the physical bottle. (This may break custom recipes or mod integrations that rely on the item's NBT. If you are a mod/pack dev, plan accordingly before updating.). A legacy mode is available to revert to the old per-item storage via NBT.
- Re-used vanilla textures for the Potion Vaporizer and Block Breaker, instead of copying vanilla textures.
- Added the ability to configure whether Ancient Brick blocks can be broken and will drop their item forms, allowing you to remove them, use them as decoration, or rebuild them elsewhere.

- Added Spectre variants of Stairs, Fences, Fence Gates and Slabs.
- Added the ability to configure whether Custom Workbenches should be disabled. ([courtesy of Bronitt](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/pull/60))
